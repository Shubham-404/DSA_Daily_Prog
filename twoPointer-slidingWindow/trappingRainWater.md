# Trapping Rain Water

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example 1:

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9


# Solution
- The approach is the find the leftMax(prefixMax) and the rightNax(suffixMax) for each element.
- You can do that with a `TC=O(2N)`, `SC=O(N)` simply using two pointers.
- Or in `TC=O(N)`, `SC=O(1)` using the optimized approach, i.e. calculating leftMax and rightMax while traversing.

```cpp
int trap(vector<int>& height) {
    int n = height.size();
    int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0, water = 0;
    int leftPt = 0, rightPt = n - 1;
    while (leftPt < rightPt) {
        if (height[leftPt] < height[rightPt]) {
            if (leftMax > height[leftPt]) {
                water += min(leftMax, height[rightPt]) - height[leftPt];
            }
            leftMax = max(leftMax, height[leftPt]);
            leftPt++;
        } else { // height[leftPt] >= height[rightPt]
            if (rightMax > height[rightPt]) {
                water += min(rightMax, height[leftPt]) - height[rightPt];
            }
            rightMax = max(rightMax, height[rightPt]);
            rightPt--;
        }
    }
    return water;
}
```
