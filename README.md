   "ðŸ”¹ Your Streak Idea
Flexing a streak is fineâ€”but let it reflect real learning:

Donâ€™t just solve easy problems to keep it aliveâ€”make sure you're progressing.

Maybe do 1 easy + 1 medium/hard per day during base-building.

You can also:

Maintain a GitHub repo where you upload your daily solutions.

This shows discipline and gives you something to show in interviews or your resume.

ðŸ”¹ After Base Topics
Once you're through arrays, strings, recursion, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, and so on:

âœ… Switch to solving daily problems on LeetCode or GFG.

âœ… Join weekly contests to simulate real-time pressure.

âœ… Practice timed mock interviews (e.g., with InterviewBit or Pramp).

ðŸ§  Final Tips
Donâ€™t overthink platform-hopping too much. Pick one main (e.g., GFG or LeetCode) and use others for variety.

Always review mistakes and write down learningsâ€”thatâ€™s how you actually improve.

Consider using something like Notion or a spreadsheet to track your progress, topics covered, and weak areas."
