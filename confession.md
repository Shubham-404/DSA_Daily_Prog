# Here's a little confession

## Nothing really spicey here, just a simple confession about not solving daily probelms, * *with a valid reason!!* *

So ah, I decided to solve DSA problems daily from... I dunno, 1st week of July, 25 I guess.
But, I didn't, and I have a valid reason for it. I was travelling to my sisters' this whole time, yes... this whole time, until 19th of August. Its not I didn't tried to, I did, I really did. 

But now, since I am back in the game at my working place, I'll do it no matter what. 

# Yeah, you'll see, you sneaky confession reader! I am watching ya.
